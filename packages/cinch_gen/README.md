## ðŸš€ Migration Guide to v6.0.0

Version 6.0.0 introduces a significant **breaking change** in how generic types are deserialized. The new implementation aligns with the `genericArgumentFactories` pattern used by `freezed` and `json_serializable`, removing the old `fromNestedGenericJson` method.

### What You Need to Do

If you use custom generic classes for your API responses (e.g., `BaseResponse<T>`), you **must** update them to be compatible with the new generator.

**1. Update Your Generic Model:**

Modify your generic class to include a `fromJson` factory that accepts a `T Function(Object?) fromJsonT` argument. This function is responsible for deserializing the nested generic type `T`.

**Before (Old Way):**

```dart
// This approach is no longer supported.
class BaseResponse<T> {
  final T data;
  BaseResponse(this.data);

  factory BaseResponse.fromNestedGenericJson(Map<String, dynamic> json, List<Type> types) {
    // ... old logic ...
  }
}
```

**After (New Way with `freezed`):**

We strongly recommend using `freezed` to generate your data classes. It handles the `genericArgumentFactories` pattern automatically.

```dart
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';

part 'base_response.freezed.dart';
part 'base_response.g.dart';

@Freezed(genericArgumentFactories: true)
sealed class BaseResponse<T> with _$BaseResponse<T> {
  const factory BaseResponse({
    required T data,
    // Add other fields like message, code, etc.
  }) = _BaseResponse;

  factory BaseResponse.fromJson(
    Map<String, dynamic> json,
    T Function(Object?) fromJsonT,
  ) =>
      _$BaseResponseFromJson(json, fromJsonT);
}
```

**2. Update Your `pubspec.yaml`:**

Make sure your dependencies are updated to the latest version.

```yaml
dependencies:
  cinch: ^6.0.0

dev_dependencies:
  cinch_gen: ^6.0.0
  build_runner: ^2.0.0
  # Add freezed and json_serializable if you use them
  freezed: <latest_version>
  json_serializable: <latest_version>
```

**3. Regenerate Your Code:**

After updating your models and dependencies, run the build runner to regenerate the Cinch client code.

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

By following these steps, your project will be aligned with the new, more robust deserialization mechanism.
